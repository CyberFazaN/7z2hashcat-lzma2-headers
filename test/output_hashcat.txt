nvmlDeviceGetFanSpeed(): Not Supported

CUDA API (CUDA 12.7)
====================
* Device #1: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, 7731/7832 MB, 24MCU

OpenCL API (OpenCL 3.0 CUDA 12.7.33) - Platform #1 [NVIDIA Corporation]
=======================================================================
* Device #2: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, skipped

This hash-mode is known to emit multiple valid candidates for the same hash.
Use --keep-guessing to continue attack after finding the first crack.

Minimum password length supported by kernel: 0
Maximum password length supported by kernel: 20

Hashes: 1 digests; 1 unique digests, 1 unique salts
Bitmaps: 16 bits, 65536 entries, 0x0000ffff mask, 262144 bytes, 5/13 rotates

Optimizers applied:
* Optimized-Kernel
* Zero-Byte
* Single-Hash
* Single-Salt
* Brute-Force

Watchdog: Temperature abort trigger set to 90c

Host memory required for this attack: 1643 MB

The wordlist or mask that you are using is too small.
This means that hashcat cannot use the full parallel power of your device(s).
Unless you supply more work, your cracking speed will drop.
For tips on supplying more work, see: https://hashcat.net/faq/morework

Approaching final keyspace - workload adjusted.

Cracking performance lower than expected?

* Append -w 3 to the commandline.
  This can cause your screen to lag.

* Append -S to the commandline.
  This has a drastic speed impact but can be better for specific attacks.
  Typical scenarios are a small wordlist but a large ruleset.

* Update your backend API runtime / driver the right way:

* Create more work items to make use of your parallelization power:
